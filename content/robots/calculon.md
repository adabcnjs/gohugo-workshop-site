_Antonio Calculon, Sr_, better known as Calculon (1960-3012) and Calculon 2.0 (circa 3013 [Exact date unknown]), is a robot actor and celebrity, created sometime before the year 1960 - for a while, he was known as David Duchovney, and then later on as a car manufacturing robot known as Calculon 1.0, who was used on the military mission to manufacture the most evil car ever from evil automobile parts - otherwise known as Project Satan. Upon its final construction, Project Satan attacked Calculon, turning him into a Were-car.

In the centuries since becoming a were-car, Calculon changed his identity and upgraded his appearance to avoid suspicion. Other names he has been known by include: Acting Unit 0.8, Thespo-mat, and David Duchovny. He was also given his "Un-holy acting talent" from the Robot Devil. It is unknown what he exchanged for this talent, if he exchanged anything at all for it.
