He is a four-ton robot designed in 2801 to judge whether people were naughty or nic–µ and sort out presents accordingly.

Due to a programming error, his standards were set way too high and Santa Bot invariably judges everyone naughty. Every year on Xmas Eve, Santa comes to Earth on his robot-reindeer sleigh to punish the naughty with extreme prejudice. It's said if someone is on the Naughty List and Robot Santa finds him or her, he will chop his or her head off and stuff his or her neck holes with toys from his sack of horrors. Usually, though, he kills them using a variety of X-Mas-themed murder devices and heavy ordnance.
